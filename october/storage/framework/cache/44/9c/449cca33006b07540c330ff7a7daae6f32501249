                    <p class="faq-top-text text-center">As a legal document, once your Will has been written, signed and witnessed it should be treated with care and securely stored to prevent damage by fire or water, loss, theft or tampering. A lost or damaged Will means that making your Will was in vain and that your estate would be subject to the rules of intestacy (See our page on Intestacy) thereby resulting in your wishes not being fulfilled and possibly excessive Inheritance Tax or other charges being paid. Your home is not the right place to store your Will, unless you have a fireproof (not fire resistant) safe.</p>

                        <h2>Secure Document Storage</h2>
                        <p>Having taken the time and trouble to put your Estate Planning in place, you need to give some thought to where the ORIGINAL documents are going to be kept.</p>
                        <p>The documents in question are made of paper. That’s obvious, but very relevant to the fact that paper is easily damaged. Water damage, fire damage or even the grandchildren using your Will as a colouring book are not uncommon! What’s more, a Will that looks like it may have been tampered with or had something removed can stop or delay its acceptance at the Probate Court.</p>
                        <p>One of the most common problems is the simple loss of your documents. Even when stored at banks and solicitors, people often find that they have great difficulty retrieving them. This difficulty increases when your family try to gain access at the time that they are needed.</p>
                        <p>Finally, if there is anything contentious in your documents, then you certainly don’t want the wrong people getting their hands on them! For example, you have three children, Joe, Mary and Ian. You have not seen Ian for 15 years and are not leaving him anything in your Will. If Ian happens to be the one that finds the Will when you are gone, he could easily “lose” the Will, and he suddenly stands to inherit!</p>
                        <p>In short, the right people need to find the right documents, in the right condition, and at the right time. TWP has a super-secure facility that ensures your documents are available when they are needed.</p>
                        <h3>Which Documents</h3>
                        <p>Here is a list of the usual documents that you might want to consider storing securely</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Last Will and Testament</li>
                            <li>Family Trust and accompanying documents</li>
                            <li>Lasting Powers of Attorney</li>
                            <li>Property Deeds</li>
                            <li>Advance Directives (Living Wills)</li>
                            <li>Funeral Plan documents</li>
                            <li>Letters of Wishes or additional information</li>
                            <li>Helpful information for family members</li>
                            <li>Policies and financial paperwork</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>What About Digital Records</h3>
                        <p>Increasingly in today’s society, there are digital records and files such as family photos, family trees, online bank statements, passwords and usernames, online accounts such as with Amazon, Paypal, Ebay and Facebook and a host of other records that you may want the family to have access to when you have gone.</p>
                        <p>The Willwriting Partnership has access to a highly-secure digital solution to fulfil this need. The facility is so secure, that the provider also has a set-up for the Royal Household using the same system!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As full members of The Society of Will Writers, we are able to provide a fully secure document storage service using the Society’s facilities. The service gives clients the confidence to relax in the knowledge that one of the most important documents they are ever likely to sign is in safe storage.</p>
                        <h3>The Benefits our Document Storage Scheme are: </h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>For a modest fee (see our List of Services page) your Will (or Wills, if you have a spouse, civil partner or informal partner) and any other important documents are in safe storage for the remainder of your life!</li>
                            <li>Every Will and document is checked for validity. This is a simple but essential check to ensure the Will has been properly executed in accordance with the law, and that there are two witnesses, neither of whom has been named in the Will.</li>
                            <li>Once the documents have been processed you will receive a Certificate of Custody and two Executor ID cards which are handed to your executors in order that they have a separate record of where the documents are stored</li>
                            <li>For added security, your executors will not be able to retrieve the Will without first producing a death certificate and proof of their identity.</li>
                            <li>The Will is dispatched promptly, normally within 24 – 48 hours, following receipt of retrieval notice along with proof of ID and the death certificate</li>
                            <li>All documents are insured against loss or damage</li>
                            <li>Where the surviving spouse/civil partner, family or friends have been appointed as executors, a free help line is available to The Trust Corporation, the Society’s sister company.</li>
                            <li>There is a free review of your Will every three years. This could be particularly significant where your circumstances have changed.</li>
                        </ol>
