                        <p>At this point, I – Antony Brinkman, the owner of this company – want to share something with you from my own point of view. Having set this company up in 1999, you might imagine that we have heard hundreds of horror stories from people that have experienced family situations where the correct legal documents were not in place. Of all the stories we hear, there are none... NONE more horrifying than the stories about what happens when a loved one did not have a Lasting Power of Attorney in place. Please, please put your LPAs in place now. Don't wait. Don't \"think about it\" - just put them in place now. And save your family from stress, heartache and seriously high costs.

Lasting Powers of Attorney were created by the government in the Mental Capacity Act 2005.
 <br>
They came into force on 1st October 2007, replacing the similar previous document – the Enduring Power of Attorney. The word “lasting” in this context means that the power may continue even if the person (though still alive) no longer has the mental capacity to exercise the power to choose an attorney.
 <br>
The format of the prescribed forms was changed in 2009. The old forms were much longer, with PFA LPAs being 28 pages long and HW LPAs being 24 pages long.
 <br>
On 1st October 2013, the fees for registering LPAs was cut from £130 each to £110 each.
 <br>
On 1st July 2015, the Office of the Public Guardian released new LPA forms. These became the compulsory format for any LPAs created on or after 1st January 2016. Industry feedback to the new forms has been positive, with most people agreeing that they are simpler and clearer. They also removed two factors that had previously been necessary in order to complete the forms.</p>

<h2>Property and Financial Affairs LPA</h2> 
 <p>
As you might expect, Property & Financial Affairs LPA allows attorneys to deal with all matters relating to the assets that the donor owns in their own name. This would include:
 Managing bank accounts, including current accounts, savings accounts and investment accounts
 Claiming and receiving benefits and other payments such as pensions, rebates, etc.
 Paying bills, household expenses and care fees
 Buying, selling and renting property of the donor
 Making gifts on the donor’s behalf
 Making decisions concerning investments
 Dealing with tax returns and tax rebates
 Paying for private medical care
 Implementing tax planning or similar arrangements
 Receiving income, inheritances or other entitlements
 Making mortgage or rent payments
 Insuring, maintaining or repairing property
 Repaying the interest or capital on loans
 Purchasing a vehicle or other equipment required
 Applying for entitlements for NHS Care or Social Care.
Note: these are examples and are not a complete list of the powers conveyed by the Property & Financial Affairs LPA.

                        <br>
                        <br>
<h2>Health and Welfare LPA</h2> 
<p> 
The powers conveyed by the Health and Welfare LPA are much less understood, and often less appreciated than the Property & Financial LPA. Yet, they can often become the more urgent and life-changing powers that are necessary to sustain your quality of life.
 Making decisions about the donor’s permanent residence
 Deciding if care is required and what level of care should be provided
 Consent or refusal of medical treatment
 Rights of access to personal information
 “Do not resuscitate” order
 It is not possible to challenge NHS decisions without this LPA. The NHS will refuse to give information under the Data Protection Act, thereby keeping your family in the dark and out of the decision-making equation.
 Under the financial assessment for care fees, a person cannot act on behalf of another without this LPA
 Lifestyle decisions such as holidays, day-trips, social, cultural or religious activities.
 Assessments for and provision of Community Care Services
 Day-to-day decisions about diet, dress and personal appearance.
Note: these are examples and are not a complete list of the powers conveyed by the Health & Welfare LPA.
